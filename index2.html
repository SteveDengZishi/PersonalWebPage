					<p>
						Nowadays big data is impacting every aspect of our lives by collecting the data around us and help us in making better and more informed decisions.Anyone with access to a Web browser can get summaries of billions of keyword searches, and this information is highly predictive of present and future economic activity, such as housing purchases and prices. Mobile phones, automobiles, factory automation systems and other devices are routinely instrumented to generate streams of data on their activities, making possible an emerging field of "reality mining" to analyze this information. Manufacturers and retailers use radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags to deliver terabits of data on inventories and supplier interactions and then feed this information into analytical models to optimize and reinvent their business processes.
					</p>

					<p>
						Much of this information is generated for free, by computers, and sits unused, at least initially. A few years after installing a large enterprise resource planning system, it is common for companies to purchase a "business intelligence" module to try to make use of the flood of data that they now have on their operations. As Ron Kohavi at Microsoft memorably put it, objective, fine-grained data are replacing HiPPOs (Highest Paid Person's Opinions) as the basis for decision-making at more and more companies.

					<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/big-data-can-guess-who-you-are-based-on-your-zip-code/381414/">Big Data Can Guess Who You Are Based on Your Zip Code</a>
					<p>
						With the massive use of data, is it not only amazing but also terrifying to see that some one can make use of these data to know who you are, your habits and your privacy. But more than that, the database is a fascinating glimpse into how marketers see the world, and how data profiles can link populations in distant cities—or not. Though cities like Portland, Oregon, and Austin, Texas, might be compared culturally, their marketing profiles are fairly distinct. And while the majority of consumers in Beverly Hills share a profile with those on Philadelphia's Main Line, for example, they don't match up with the profile for residents of similarly expensive zip codes on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the United States, where there are virtually no regulations on data collection, someone trying to profile you can fairly easily learn how much money you make, your education level, whether you own a home, who you voted for, how many kids you have, how much credit card debt you're carrying, even what you thought of the series finale of How I Met Your Mother.  

						The scope of the American data machine is staggering. A Federal Trade Commission report released earlier this year found the firm Datalogix, a partner of Facebook, has marketing data about almost every U.S. household—plus information detailing more than $1 trillion in consumer transactions.
